// Exercise 16: Use chaining to double the even numbers and then sum them.
// Example: [3, 10, 15, 7, 22, 18] â†’ 100
// Use method chaining and write the solution in one line

const numbers = [3, 10, 15, 7, 22, 18]

console.log(numbers.filter(num => num % 2 === 0).map(num => num * 2).reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr))// Expected output: 100
